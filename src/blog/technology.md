Technology is fascinating. It drives us forward while holding us down.

We who devote our lives to inventing, refining, and sharing technology
are doomed to witness how the sobering reality of its effects pierces
the otherwise immaculate dream of its endless possibility.

Two steps forward, one step back.

More than a decade ago, the smartphone put an unfathomable trove of
knowledge and connection in our pocket. Today, the same devices compel
us to scroll endlessly through AI-driven feeds to our quiet dismay.

Today, our colleagues hearld the revolution of a distributed third
phase of the web, while the masses are split between a profit-crazed
hoard of guileless speculators and a pessimistic old guard that condemns
the technology that spured them on.

What can we do?
